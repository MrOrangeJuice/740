This program allows the user to draw points, lines, triangles, quads, and a polygon, by selecting the desired object under the "Objects" section in the right click menu 
The user can also change color, point size, and line width (this feature may be broken on some or all machines, I wasn't entirely sure) using the right click menu,
however color can also be changed by pressing 1 (red), 2 (green), 3 (blue) on the keyboard.
